<sup>
<br/>
A) Full file names of Private and Client added, original truncated file extentions throw an error<br/>
B) Random function fixed and simplified.  Old version caused 'sticky' numbers<br/>
C) Removed package-lock.json as files is regenerated  with 'npm init' so redundent<br/>

A Really simple IoT "thing" for connecting to AWS IoT.

Get an IoT certificate & key from AWS IoT Core and place them in this directory, named cert.pem and private.pem.

Run npm install to download dependencies

Run this simulator with:

npm start HOST STAGE CLIENTID

Where HOST is the MQTT endpoint for an AWS account, STAGE is the name of an environment (dev, prod, etc), and CLIENTID is a unique identifier for this "thing".

See messages published to the IoT topic iotsample/STAGE/CLIENTID/data in the AWS IoT Core Console.
