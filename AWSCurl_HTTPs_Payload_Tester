HTTPs with certs to IoT Core (MQTT test client: Subscribe)

//check your current AWS IoT Core Region
//change the nme of your certicifates to: 

a04r7f8e71-certificate.pem  -->  device.pem
a04r7f8ee71-private.pem.key --> private.pem.key

//insert your own AWS IoT endpoint and topic name (here i called the topic: "myTopic")

curl --tlsv1.2 --cacert Amazon-root-CA-1.pem --cert device.pem.crt --key private.pem.key --request POST --data "{\"Temperature\": 77, \"Humidity\": 88, \"Time\": 12349876,\"Device_ID\": \"device_4\"}" "https://a32qxxxkugfxxx-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8443/topics/myTopic?qos=1"

Troubleshooting:
//Use cURL commands in same dirctory as curl.exe or you may receive error: 
// _curl: (35) schannel: failed to receive handshake, SSL/TLS connection failed_
//Insert all three of your enabled and activated device certificates into the same directory (with curl.exe to make things easy with pathing)

//curl: (35) schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: CRYPT_E_REVOKED (0x80092010) - The certificate is revoked.
//check that you changesd the certificate names to match the names in your curl command
